# criminality-by-design

This project is an artistic and activist attempt to expose Israeli surveillance and its system of automated occupation and apartheid.
You will follow the journey of a young child passing through a checkpoint in Hebron.
The project attempts to highlight the potentials and actualities of surveillance, facial recognition and big data.

Begin with: landing.html

You will then begin the experience, with the opportunity to go back to the other pages.

This is the beginning of hopefully a wider project in bringing artistic and activist interventions into academia.

Until liberation,
Nuvpreet
